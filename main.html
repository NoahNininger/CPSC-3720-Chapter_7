<!--
   Create a class which will allow you to work out the combined price
   of a number of items, and interact with it to work out the 
   total cost of different orders.

      1. Create a class that contains the prices of two menu items 
         as private field declarations.

      2. Use the constructor in the class to get the argument values 
         (how many of each item are being bought).

      3. Create a method to calculate and return the total cost
         depending on how many of each item the user selects.

      4. Use a getter property to grab the value output by the 
         calculation method.

      5. Create two or three objects with different combinations of 
         menu selections, and output the total cost in the console.
